# Iris-Data-Analysis-in-MS-Excel

This dataset includes measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width of 150 iris flowers, which belong to 3 different species: setosa, versicolor and virginica. The iris dataset has 150 rows and 5 columns, which are stored as a dataframe, including a column for the species of each flower.

The description of its variables includes:


Sepal.Length - The sepal.length represents the length of the sepal in centimetres.
Sepal.Width - The sepal.width represents the width of the sepal in centimetres.
Petal.Length - The petal.length represents the length of the petal in centimetres.
Species - The species variable represents the species of the iris flower, with three possible values: setosa, versicolor and virginica.

One use case of the Iris dataset in Excel is to analyze the relationship between the different features of the Iris flower and classify the flower species based on the feature values. This can be done using techniques such as correlation analysis, inferential statistics, and predictive modeling.
